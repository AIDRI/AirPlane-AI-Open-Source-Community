Warning: this project is an AI project, but remember that AI is based on math.  
It is therefore allowed to create a project based only on math, or with a part of
AI, etc...  

Third part docs:  
- This is certainly the most complicated part of the project. This part can be divided into two parts: 
  1. First, you have to be able to manage the plane, that is to say manage its altitude, but above all manage the plane at the landing and taxiway level. You have to assign to the plane the best runway, in terms of its length (a small plane will need a small runway, and vice versa), but also in terms of the paths to take to reach a parking place.
In this first step, it is implied that there is only one plane on the air corridor and only one plane on the airport.

   Rather simple, perhaps...

   2. The second part is one of the most complex parts of this project: you have to retrieve information from all the surrounding planes to be able to manage the altitude, etc... You also need to retrieve this information to calculate the optimal runway and taxiways to avoid traffic jams and takeoff accidents. This part is quite complex, but I think it is very useful for our project. This second part allows us to make the project more complex by adding several planes on the air corridor, but also on the airport, and several landing requests.
