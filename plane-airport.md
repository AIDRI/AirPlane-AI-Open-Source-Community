Here, are some infos about the airport and the plane who we are using.

For this project, we will use the runways and taxiways of this airport as a model.

The test aircraft will be a Cesna 172: here is a sheet with these useful characteristics:  
Length: 8.28 meters  
Wingspan: 11 m  
Height: 2.72 m  
Wing area: 16.2 m2  
Unladen mass: 744 kg  
Payload: 415 kg  
Maximum take-off weight: 1.157 kg  

Altitude of the airport : 820 ft
Gravity of the airport: 9.81 m/s^2  

This data can be useful for moving the aircraft by using, for example, the formulas for the
dynamic modeling.
